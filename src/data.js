This involved interpreting complex sponsor requirements and structuring that information for input into Oracle PeopleSoft. This foundational work was critical for the successful initiation of all new research endeavors. This required a deep understanding of grant and data administration to ensure compliance and accuracy from the outset.\n\n**Initiative: Bridging the Data Gap:** Recognizing the limitations of our existing reporting, I took the initiative to develop a suite of automated reporting tools. This began with leveraging advanced Excel functionalities to streamline immediate data analysis needs. I then pioneered the development of a comprehensive suite of Power BI dashboards from the ground up, a significant step forward in our data visualization and business intelligence capabilities.\n\n**Impact: Influencing Strategic Decisions:** The culmination of my initiative was the delivery of critical, bi-weekly KPIs to the Vice-Provost. These dashboards provided a clear and concise overview of financial and operational performance, transforming raw data into strategic insights. This directly influenced high-level decision-making and provided a consistent, reliable source of information for leadership."

To improve our scalability, I initiated and implemented a metadata-driven file system. Concurrently, I developed a comprehensive 6-month strategic plan to re-architect the core pipeline, which was causing burnout, and presented it to leadership with a full risk analysis.\n\n**Processes & Methods:** The metadata-driven system turned the complex process of adding new products into a simple configuration change, promoting process scalability. For the strategic plan, I leveraged my skills in Risk Assessment & Mitigation and Stakeholder Management to advocate for a non-disruptive POC that would prove the value of the re-architecture in saving time and money.\n\n**Quantifiable Results & Impact:** The new file system significantly improved the team's agility and ability to scale.
